# _Product Webpage_

#### _Epicodus CSS week 2 code review project_

#### By _**Oskar Radon**_

## Description

Create a responsive webpage that is similar to [Andersson-Wise](http://www.anderssonwise.com/).

It must be fluid and have breakpoints at three different screen sizes.

It does not need to be pixel-perfect, nor does it need to use the same styling techniques as the example. Prioritize responsiveness and structure.

It does not need to incorporate the same assets (e.g. images, fonts).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_View it [here](https://oskarradon.github.io/responsive-code-review/) on GitHub Pages or download it as a zip/clone it, and check it out!_

## Technologies Used

_Just CSS and HTML! Although I'd really like to try implementing flex box instead of floats, [for example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30587086/implementing-a-mondrian-pattern-using-flexbox)._
